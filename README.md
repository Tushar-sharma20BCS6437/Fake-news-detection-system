# Fake-news-detection-system
Fake news has become a significant problem in today's media landscape, and the ability to detect false or misleading information is crucial for promoting the dissemination of accurate and trustworthy news. In this study, we suggest a hybrid system for detecting fake news that incorporates source analysis and machine learning techniques.
The proposed system uses a combination of techniques, includes text classification, named entity identification, and sentiment analysis, to extract relevant features from news articles. These features are then used to train Deep learning algorithms to distinguish between real and fake news. Using a sizable dataset of manually annotated news stories, we test the effectiveness of our system and compare it to other cutting-edge false news detection algorithms.
